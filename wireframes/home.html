        <h3>Work with team focused accessibility.</h3>
        <p>
            With PrefCards, you can control who is able to edit your preference
            card. Allow only people you trust to edit your preference card.
            This ensures consistency across procedures and allows staff
            to come and go knowing that the equipment and patient information 
            is as it should be.
